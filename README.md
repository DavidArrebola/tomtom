# Thought Process and Design Decisions for TomTom API Integration Package

## Modularity

The project was structured to enhance modularity by separating concerns and promoting reusability. Key components and functionalities were divided into helper functions and utility modules, simplifying testing and maintenance.

**Key Points:**

- **Utility Functions**: Isolated helper functions for API key management and parameter setting.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct modules for API requests, error handling, and parameter management.

## API Key Management

Centralized API key management to ensure secure and consistent handling, minimizing risks and redundancy.

**Key Points:**

- **Centralized Management**: `setApiKey` function retrieves and validates the API key from environment variables.
- **Secure Handling**: Centralized approach minimizes exposure of the API key.

## Naming Conventions and Code Consistency

Maintained consistency in naming conventions and function declarations for a clean, professional codebase.

**Key Points:**

- **File Naming**: Kebab casing for file names (e.g., `set-api-key.ts`, `set-params.ts`).
- **Function Declarations**: Standard function declarations over arrow functions.
- **Async/Await**: Used async/await for better readability and error handling.

## Flexibility for Consumers

Designed to allow additional parameters, ensuring the package can be easily customized and extended.

**Key Points:**

- **Additional Parameters**: `setParams` function accepts and merges additional parameters with default settings.
- **Extendability**: Flexible design accommodates future enhancements or API changes.

## Testing and Coverage

Focused on good test coverage to ensure reliability, facilitated by the modular design.

**Key Points:**

- **Unit Tests**: Isolated tests for individual functions and modules.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Verified overall functionality with the TomTom API integration.
